- electric ignition system (nervous system):  
`deposit` ŒûTH if nervous about its price,  
or USDe (et. al.) to maximise your time value of $  

- `repackNFT`: fuel management system  
controlled by the electrical system,  
as are its sensors, observing temp.  
(tick) and air density (tick range)...  

- `redeem` engine has a cooling system  
`fold` suspension is related:  
determines your ride quality  

where water‚Äôs thirsty and bread loaf is like stone  
in times of sacred wooing üíç as today prepares

having empathy for the ‚Ä®experience, saving others the same‚Ä¶

stuck in the contract.
a debt that has been drawn against ETH collat  
should eventually eat up enough collat for close itself. all the stables  
deposited should eventually be able to leave (completely) in exchange  
for burning GD. the total supply of GD should be reduce-able to zero.
