Placing rappers in endangerment, who's reckless?  
With this food for thought sorta' like breakfast,  
You could mark it off as wreck on a checklist:  
"squeezing water outta stones and eating bearer bonds," like  
Shahmen Mangroves, my 5 string serenade kicks off
with 5  
 wagon and an all sixes `KICKBACK` that's dedication 6,
24 times. I dont really care if you cry, should've saw 
the way she looked me in my eye, I am not a friend to DAI
only, as we have  
a [basket](https://www.calamos.com/capabilities/structured-protection-etfs/) of 5 stables and a basketball in the `fold` call
the exorcist told me `MO` possessive, no pedestrians, 
Nino and Tony and Mitch, rose out of stone, GHO get a clone,
4 revenue streams, so liquidations aren‚Äôt that emphatic, both   
in the sense of no emphasis on them being a revenue source,  
and in the sense that you don‚Äôt lose all your collateral at

there should never be a state where assets can get permanently  
stuck in the contract. I just popped a perp and, Rick,
the ruler slick, you just called a witch who called you bitch,
a debt that has been drawn against...ETH collat...make you eat
your words, make you chew on your chit like it's a quidbit,
should eventually eat up enough collat for close itself. all the stables  
deposited should eventually be able to leave (completely) in exchange  
for burning GD. the total supply of GD should be reduce-able to zero.  
like knocking out every tooth you pick, a fact for you and who you're with.
Another for dessert.
