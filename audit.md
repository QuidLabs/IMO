## Invariants

Moulinette is a beast for everyone to have a feast. 
The beat kicks off with 5 wagon, as we have a basket
of 5 stables; we already has 4 revenue streams, so  liquidations aren’t emphatic, both in the sense  that…there is no emphasis on them being a  revenue source (as with liquity), and in the  sense that you don’t lose all your collateral  at once (so there is no catharsis). They are,  empathic, rather: having empathy for the  experience, saving others the same…

there should never be a state where assets can get permanently stuck in the contract.
a debt that has been drawn against ETH collat should eventually eat up enough collat for close itself.

all the stables deposited should eventually be able to leave (completely) in exchange for burning QD. 

the total supply of QD should be reduce-able to zero.
