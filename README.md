# exposure closure

Preobra**zhenskiƒ≠** offfered me a test üßê     
started with a question, "how can you  
know for whom to open the door," and   
ended in her ghosting (`viaAAVE` üëª).  
In Latin, door is "Ostium"...o—Å—Ç—Ä—ã–π —É–º

Whether depositing liquidity out-of-range, or  
letting the contract auto-manage the range...  
*B*unni *O*verloaded complements Perena with  
a `Basket` boosted by a ~~basketballer cross  
over~~ "[rider](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/loan-agreement-rider) on the storm, actor out on loan."

The primary export of both Madagascar and  
our saving gas car is `VANILLA`: a UniswapV4  
colloquialism for PoolKeys not using hooks...  
Unlike a regular USDC<>WETH pool, "what  
you got in the stable? This is hungry work:"     

there's zero-IL *single-sided provision*;  
if a swap can't be fulfilled by internal  
liquidity alone, it gets split between  
our router and the legacy V3 router;  

*sandwich protection* is embedded as   
batching (**A**pp-**S**pecific **S**equence)...  
depositors of dollars are able to get  
their yield tokenised upfront through    
1-month+ bond (ERC**69**09 extension):  

*this incentivises always having dollars*  
available to be paired with ETH in V4...  
in being abstract, swaps are executed  
using ‚Äúvirtual balances‚Äù; this way ETH  

gets deposited in Gauntlet's **Morpho vault**,  
and not in the PoolManager, while various  
dollars are either in Morpho vaults or their  
native staking (e.g. GHO‚Äôs safety module).     

providing an incentivised way to move   
liquidity from UniV3 to V4 `viaAAVE`:    
‚Äú**levered swaps**‚Äù take longer, but  
are guaranteed to be profitable...

the day when you were gone."
